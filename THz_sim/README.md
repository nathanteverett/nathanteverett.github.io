Cocker Group Repository

This repository contains the THz STM Simulation.

For information on how to use main program, THz_Sim.py, view the series of jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) for examples of use. The main program can be viewed with simple examples in the notebook THz_STM_Simulation.ipynb. Each part has more complex examples given in a corresponding notebook referenced at the top of that section. Note that the supplementary notebooks are less detailed and have fewer comments than the main program.
